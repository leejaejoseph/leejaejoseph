### 📜 About Me
Hello! My name is Joseph Lee, and I am a full-stack web developer. I have shifted from media marketing, dabbled in content creation, and have landed towards software engineering. Engineering really brings life to projects that I want to work on and one of my goals is to project manage a full scale startup from aspects from PR and marketing to full-stack development. As a developer, I have a keen ability to analyze market/client needs and create solutions that build on my intuition of seeing the big picture. I get heavily interested in the newer technologies towards the back-end that really allows optimizations of data whilst making it aesthetically pleasing for the clients.
